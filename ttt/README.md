# Test-time Training

This folder illustrates the test-time training method whereby a transformer (neural net) is fine-tuned on the training examples from a given task, prior to making a prediction on the test example.

The key script is `trelis-ttt.ipynb` and it includes test time training techniques AND depth-first search.
