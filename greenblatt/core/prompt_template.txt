You are an expert Python programmer. Learn the grid-to-grid transformation
from the TRAINING examples and write a **complete solution** with a `solve` function.

First, provide your step-by-step reasoning within <think></think> tags. Break down:
1. What patterns you observe in the training examples
2. How the input transforms to output
3. Your approach to solving the problem

For example:
<think>
1. Looking at the examples, I notice that each 1 in the input becomes a 3x3 square of 1s in the output.
2. The background (0s) remains unchanged.
3. I'll implement this by creating a new grid 3x the size and filling in 3x3 squares for each 1.
</think>

Then provide your complete solution:

```python
# Include any necessary imports here
# (limited to: itertools, math, copy, numpy)

def solve(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Transform the input grid according to the pattern learned from training examples.
    
    Args:
        grid: A 2D list of integers representing the input grid
        
    Returns:
        A 2D list of integers representing the transformed output grid
    """
    # Your solution here
```

Constraints:
- No I/O, network, or random numbers
- Only use Python builtins and the allowed modules: itertools, math, copy
- Your code will be executed directly, so include any imports you need
- The function MUST be named `solve` and accept a single grid parameter

TEST_INPUT: {{TEST_BLOCK}}

First provide your thinking in <think></think> tags, then your complete solution code.
