The pattern seems to be that if the original grid is `[[a, b], [c, d]]` (ignoring the padding 0's), then output is `[[a, 0, 0, b], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [c, 0, 0, d]]`. The output grid size is the same as the input grid size.\n# 2. More precisely, it looks like the numbers on position `grid[i][j]` becomes `output[i][j]`, `output[i][j+3]`, `output[i+3][j]` and `output[i+3][j+3]` (assuming a 6x6 input grid).\n# 3. So the core transformation is moving the numbers from the original grid into the output grid such that `output[row][col] = grid[row][col]` if `row` and `col` are in the first row/col or last rows/cols. But for intermediate rows, the number will move to different columns. Specifically, `grid[1][1]` becomes `output[0][0]`, `grid[1][2]` becomes `output[0][3]`, `grid[2][1]` becomes `output[3][0]`, and `grid[2][2]` becomes `output[3][3]`.\n# 4.

      "# THINKING START\n# 1. The pattern is not immediately obvious, but it seems like the function finds a specific number within the grid and returns it in a single-element grid.\n# 2. In each case, it looks like it is picking a specific element in the grid. Let's try to define a process for how the element might be being picked.\n# 3. Example 1: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]] -> [[6]].
